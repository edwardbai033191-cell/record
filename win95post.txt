Do You Still Remember Windows 95?

In 1995, Windows 95 changed everything.

For many of us, it was the first time a computer felt personal —
the Start button, the taskbar, the mouse-driven UI, the sound of dial-up, and that iconic boot screen that meant the future just arrived.

Fast forward nearly 30 years.

And now… you can run Windows 95 inside your browser.

Yes — really.

A developer built a full Windows 95 environment using Electron + JavaScript, packaged from the original OS binaries, and open-sourced it on GitHub:

You can launch it, open Paint, write in Notepad, play Minesweeper — all from a modern web browser.

No VM.
No emulator.
No install.

Just the web.
